**The Agent IDE** — Build, debug, and ship AI agents visually.

> *rakit* (Indonesian: craft) + *jiritsu* (Japanese: autonomous) — "autonomous assembly"

Design multi-agent systems on a drag-and-drop canvas, debug with breakpoints and time-travel, deploy as a single zero-dependency binary. YAML-configured, multi-provider, open source.

<!-- TODO: hero GIF — the visual builder in motion: drag two agents onto the
     canvas, wire a tool between them, hit Run, watch the debugger stream the
     execution tree live. ~10s loop, ~1200px wide, matches the app's theme. -->
<!-- Alt text when the asset lands: "Rakitsu visual builder — two agents wired
     on a drag-and-drop canvas with the live execution tree streaming below." -->

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install (Linux / macOS)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paupawsan/rakitsu/main/install.sh | sh

# Create your first project (interactive wizard)
rakitsu quickstart

# Or jump straight into the web UI
rakitsu serve
```

Open **http://localhost:9100** — drag agents onto the canvas, wire up tools, hit Run.

## Why Rakitsu?

- **Visual-first**: Design agents on a drag-and-drop canvas, not in code
- **Debug like software**: Breakpoints, pause, inspect reasoning mid-execution
- **Single binary**: One file, zero dependencies — download and run
- **YAML-configured**: Declarative configs, no framework code to write
- **Multi-provider**: Mix OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, Ollama per-agent in one config

## Features

**Visual Builder**
- Vue Flow canvas: drag agents, wire tools, group into pipelines
- Block programming: pipeline, parallel, and team groups
- Inherit/override: group defines defaults, agents override, with badges
- Canvas search, auto-arrange, hierarchy panel

**Runtime Debugger**
- Set breakpoints on any agent or tool node
- Pause mid-execution, inspect reasoning, override parameters, resume
- 4 visualization modes: Tree, Block Diagram, Timeline, Mind Map
- Playback scrubbing on completed runs

**Agent Engine**
- ReAct loop with reflection and ground-checking
- Orchestration strategies: Sequential, Parallel, Hierarchical, DAG, Plan-and-Execute
- Pipeline checkpoint and resume
- Token budget enforcement, cost tracking, context auto-compression

**Providers**
- OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, Ollama, LiteLLM
- Mix providers per-agent in a single config
- Auto-discover models from any OpenAI-compatible endpoint

**Runtime portability (optional)**
- Primary runtime is the Rakitsu binary; for teams shipping to alternative runtimes, configs export via the `RuntimeTarget` interface
- Built-in formats: NemoClaw, OpenClaw — see [Export Verification](#export-verification)

**Operations**
- Session history with replay and rerun
- CLI and web UI modes
- Secure tools: CLI whitelist/blocklist, file path restrictions, Docker sandbox
- Cross-platform: Linux, macOS, Windows (amd64 + arm64)

## CLI

```bash
rakitsu quickstart                    # Interactive project wizard
rakitsu serve                         # Web UI + agent runner
rakitsu run config.yaml "query"       # Run agents from CLI
rakitsu scaffold code-review          # Generate config from template
rakitsu sessions                      # Browse past runs
rakitsu doctor config.yaml            # Diagnose config + provider health before running

# Override provider/model at runtime (no config edits needed):
rakitsu run config.yaml "query" --provider litellm --model gpt-4o
rakitsu run config.yaml "query" --provider ollama --model llama3
```

## Example Config

```yaml
name: Code Reviewer
settings:
  default_provider: openai
  providers:
    openai:
      type: openai
      api_key: ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
  defaults:
    model: gpt-4o-mini

tools:
  - name: read_file
    type: fs
    operation: read

agents:
  - name: Reviewer
    role: worker
    provider: openai
    model: gpt-4o
    system_prompt: Review code for bugs, security issues, and best practices.
    tools: [read_file]

orchestrator:
  name: Lead
  strategy: Pipeline
  agents: [Reviewer]
```

Optional settings blocks:

```yaml
settings:
  spawn:              # runtime subagent fan-out (spawn_agent tool)
    enabled: true
    max_concurrent: 3 # run-global cap on concurrent children (default 4)
    max_depth: 1      # children cannot spawn further (default)
    timeout_seconds: 300
```

With `settings.spawn.enabled`, every agent (and the interactive chat host) gets a `spawn_agent` tool: it can spawn parallel subagents at runtime — ad-hoc workers or clones of config-defined agents — each with its own timeout, streamed into the same trace/debugger with explicit parent links. See [examples/single/10-spawn-fanout/](examples/single/10-spawn-fanout/).

See [examples/](examples/) for chat bots, dev teams, pipelines, RAG assistants, and more.

## Export Verification

Rakitsu's `RuntimeTarget` exports are verified end-to-end against real infrastructure — not claims, real HTTP traces. The current implementations cover OpenClaw and NVIDIA NemoClaw; the table below shows what each was tested against.

### What's Verified

| Component | Runtime Tested Against | Result |
|-----------|-----------------------|--------|
| `openclaw.json` | `ghcr.io/openclaw/openclaw:latest` (Docker) | Gateway started with Rakitsu-generated config |
| `sandbox-policy.yaml` | NVIDIA OpenShell on DGX Spark (aarch64) | `Policy version 2 loaded (active)` |
| Full NemoClaw sandbox | NemoClaw CLI in docker-in-docker, sandbox created with Landlock+seccomp+netns | `Policy version 6 loaded (active)` |
| End-to-end inference | NemoClaw sandbox → egress proxy → DGX Spark Nemotron-30B | **HTTP 200 chat completion** |

### E2E Test Setup

```
docker:dind (local host)
  └── NemoClaw CLI + OpenShell gateway (k3s-in-Docker)
       └── Sandbox "my-assistant" (Landlock + seccomp + netns)
            └── OpenClaw agent
                 └── Rakitsu-exported openclaw.json  ←── our export
                 └── Rakitsu-exported sandbox-policy  ←── our export
                 └── HTTP request to DGX Spark (via egress proxy)
                      └── LiteLLM → vLLM → Nemotron-30B
                           └── HTTP 200 chat completion ✓
```

All files destroyed with `docker rm -f` after verification — no residual state. The heavy E2E test is **manual only**; unit regression tests guard the export schema (binary allowlist, port extraction, env var expansion) and run on every CI build.

See [docs/EXPORT-VERIFICATION.md](docs/EXPORT-VERIFICATION.md) for the full audit trail.

## Troubleshooting

**"openai API key not set"** — Export your key before running:
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

**"cannot load config: no such file or directory"** — Check the config path. Try `ls examples/single/` to see available configs.

**"cannot create provider for agent …"** — An agent references a provider that isn't defined. Add it under `settings.providers` in your config, and make sure the agent's `provider:` field matches the provider name exactly.

**"is port 9100 already in use?"** — Another `rakitsu serve` may be running. Kill it or use a different port:
```bash
rakitsu serve --port 8080
```

**Agent runs but produces no output** — Check `--trace` for execution details:
```bash
rakitsu run config.yaml "query" --trace --verbose
```

**Multi-agent run times out** — Default is 300s. Increase with `--timeout`:
```bash
rakitsu run config.yaml "query" --timeout 600
```

**Output starts with `[REASONING-ONLY OUTPUT — …]`** — The model (typically nemotron, DeepSeek-R1, QwQ) consumed its `max_tokens` budget on chain-of-thought before emitting any user-facing answer. Three production-ready alternatives are documented in [docs/providers/reasoning-models.md](docs/providers/reasoning-models.md): keep the default and rely on extraction, swap synthesis to Gemini, or run hybrid (local workers + cloud synthesis).

## Origin

Rakitsu began in spring 2026 as a small project to support my son. It was
supposed to stay small — it didn't. The problem turned out to be genuinely
interesting, and it grew into serious, long-term work. It remains a family
project at heart.

Rakitsu is built openly with AI: it is co-developed by a human and AI coding
assistants. Design decisions, code review, and final verification are human;
a large share of the implementation is AI-assisted. See
[`AI_USE_NOTICE.md`](AI_USE_NOTICE.md) for how AI tooling relates to the
license.
