// single turn — session/new mints the identity before any prompt exists, and

// here is narrower: hold the *current* turn's cancel func (so a
// session/cancel notification has something to call), remember whether that
// turn was cancelled (so the turn's own completion path can tell a
// cancellation-caused error apart from a real failure), and accumulate prior
// turns' query/response text — executeConfig (the RunFunc every turn calls)
