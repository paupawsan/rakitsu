// RecordTranscript stores an agent's settled conversation, replacing any
// prior one. Called from the transcript sink, which fires on the agent's own
// goroutine as its run returns — before the tool registry is closed. An agent
// that was never registered is recorded as a spawned child rather than
// dropped: the sink firing is proof the agent existed.
//
// runErr is the run's own outcome and decides the recorded status (see
// statusFor). The sink fires on EVERY exit path, so without it a child that
// hit settings.spawn.timeout_seconds, a provider error, or its own
// max_iterations budget was stored as StatusDone and offered to the user as
// "done — N turns". The transcript is still retained in all three cases — the
// run you most want to ask about is the one that did not finish — but it is
// labelled honestly.
//
// Turns is counted from the full, pre-truncation history: it answers "how
// many times was this agent addressed", a fact about the conversation that
// does not shrink just because the stored transcript later gets trimmed for
// space. A byte-truncated entry and a fully evicted one (Turns == 0,
// StatusEvicted) stay distinguishable this way — truncation never reports a
// smaller turn count than what actually happened.

// The history is copied before storage, so the caller mutating its own slice
// (or its backing array) afterward can never reach into what the roster
// retains.
