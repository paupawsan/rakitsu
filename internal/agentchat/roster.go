// Package agentchat implements directed agent chat: addressing one agent in
// a session directly, separate from the main conversation.
//
// The model is COLD RETENTION. Agents are destroyed on the normal schedule —
// a spawned child's tool registry is closed the moment its run returns, so no
// MCP subprocess outlives it. What survives is the child's transcript,
// captured through agent.SetTranscriptSink just before teardown. When the
// user wants to talk to that agent, it is rebuilt from its recorded
// definition and replayed with the retained history. Agents hold no
// conversation state of their own, which is what makes this possible.
//
// This package must not import package main. The rebuild step arrives as an
// injected Builder closure, the same pattern spawn.Factory uses.
