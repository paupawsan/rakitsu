// TestPersistTreeRaw_SkipsStaleGeneration regression-guards: persistTree
// (turn-finalize path) and broadcastTreeMutationLocked (branch-op path)
// each independently snapshot the tree under s.mu, then write to disk after
// releasing it — nothing serialized the two writes against each other. A
// branch op racing a turn finalize could have the OLDER snapshot's write
// land on disk after the NEWER one's, silently reverting state below what
// was actually last true in memory. Tested deterministically against the
// low-level write path directly (not via racing goroutines, which can't
// reliably reproduce which write "wins" — see the DetachDebugger fix in
// round 4 for the same lesson): call the newer generation's write first,
// then the (now-stale) older generation's write, and confirm the older one
// is dropped rather than overwriting what's already on disk.
