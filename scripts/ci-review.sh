## Automated review

This review was generated automatically by this repo's automated review
pipeline, not a human — it ran rakitsu against openai/gpt-5.6-luna over
$SCOPE_TEXT, reading file content and diffs as text only, no code
execution. Treat findings as a starting point to verify, not a final word.
