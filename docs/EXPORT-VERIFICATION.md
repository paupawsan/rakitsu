# NemoClaw / OpenShell Export Verification

End-to-end verification that Rakitsu-generated deployment files actually work with NVIDIA's real infrastructure. Not documentation claims — real HTTP traces, real sandboxes, real inference responses.

## Date

2026-04-04 — during M0 adoption sprint, ahead of public release.

## Summary

Rakitsu's `rakitsu export --format nemoclaw` command produces two files:

- `openclaw.json` — agent configuration (models, providers, tools)
- `sandbox-policy.yaml` — OpenShell security policy (filesystem, network, process rules)

Both files were verified against real NemoClaw/OpenShell sandbox infrastructure by running a full deployment and sending a real chat completion request that returned an HTTP 200 from an NVIDIA Nemotron-3-Super-120B endpoint through a sandboxed egress proxy. The inference backend itself was a local GPU host reached via a LiteLLM proxy, not NVIDIA's hosted inference — see Test Environment below for the exact setup.

**Scope**: This verification covers **single-agent exports only**. Multi-agent orchestration scripts (`orchestrate.sh`, `delegate.sh`, `docker-compose.yaml`) are generated but have NOT been E2E tested on NemoClaw infrastructure. The orchestration scripts use verified NemoClaw CLI commands (confirmed from source at `github.com/NVIDIA/NemoClaw`), but the file-transfer + SSH-exec pattern for multi-sandbox coordination has not been validated end-to-end.

## Test Environment

| Component | Version / Host |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Host** | macOS (arm64) |
| **Outer container** | `docker:dind` (privileged) |
| **Inner Docker** | 29.3.1 (build c2be9cc) |
| **NemoClaw** | v0.0.4 |
| **OpenShell** | 0.0.22 |
| **OpenClaw** | 2026.3.11 (29dc654) |
| **Sandbox image** | `ghcr.io/nvidia/openshell-community/sandboxes/openclaw:latest` |
| **Inference target** | a local GPU inference host (aarch64) via LiteLLM proxy |
| **Model** | `your-model-alias` via LiteLLM proxy |

Everything inside the outer `docker:dind` container. Teardown with `docker rm -f` removes all state.

## Verification Steps

### 1. Export Rakitsu config to NemoClaw format

```bash
./bin/rakitsu export --format nemoclaw rakitsu-e2e.yaml --output /tmp/rakitsu-e2e/export
```

**Output**: `openclaw.json` + `sandbox-policy.yaml` + `AGENT.md` + `README.md`.

### 2. Install NemoClaw inside DinD

```bash
docker run --privileged -d --name rakitsu-nemoclaw-test docker:dind
docker exec rakitsu-nemoclaw-test sh -c 'apk add --no-cache curl bash nodejs npm xz perl-utils lsof openssh-client'
docker exec rakitsu-nemoclaw-test sh -c 'curl -fsSL https://www.nvidia.com/nemoclaw.sh | NEMOCLAW_INSTALL_TAG=v0.0.4 NEMOCLAW_NON_INTERACTIVE=1 bash -s -- --yes-i-accept-third-party-software'
```

### 3. Onboard NemoClaw (creates OpenShell gateway + sandbox)

```bash
docker exec -e NVIDIA_API_KEY="..." rakitsu-nemoclaw-test sh -c \
  'NEMOCLAW_NON_INTERACTIVE=1 NEMOCLAW_ACCEPT_THIRD_PARTY_SOFTWARE=1 nemoclaw onboard --yes-i-accept-third-party-software'
```

**Output excerpt**:
```
✓ Gateway ready
  Name: nemoclaw
  Endpoint: https://127.0.0.1:8080/
✓ Active gateway set to 'nemoclaw'
...
✓ Sandbox 'my-assistant' created
...
Sandbox      my-assistant (Landlock + seccomp + netns)
Model        nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b (NVIDIA Endpoints)
```

### 4. Copy the exported files into the container

Step 1 wrote `sandbox-policy.yaml` and `openclaw.json` on the host; the
container needs its own copies before the next steps can reference them:

```bash
docker cp /tmp/rakitsu-e2e/export/sandbox-policy.yaml rakitsu-nemoclaw-test:/tmp/rakitsu-policy.yaml
docker cp /tmp/rakitsu-e2e/export/openclaw.json rakitsu-nemoclaw-test:/tmp/rakitsu-openclaw.json
```

### 5. Apply Rakitsu-generated policy

```bash
docker exec rakitsu-nemoclaw-test sh -c \
  'openshell policy set my-assistant --policy /tmp/rakitsu-policy.yaml --wait'
```

**Output**:
```
✓ Policy version 6 submitted (hash: ee17f3214250)
✓ Policy version 6 loaded (active version: 6)
```

The policy submitted was the byte-exact file Rakitsu wrote to `sandbox-policy.yaml`.

### 6. Upload Rakitsu openclaw.json into the sandbox

```bash
openshell sandbox upload my-assistant /tmp/rakitsu-openclaw.json /sandbox/rakitsu-openclaw.json
```

### 7. Verify OpenClaw parses Rakitsu config

```bash
ssh openshell-my-assistant \
  'OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH=/sandbox/rakitsu-openclaw.json openclaw --profile rakitsu-test agents list'
```

**Output excerpt**:
```
Agents:
- assistant (default) (Assistant)
  Workspace: ~/.openclaw/workspace-rakitsu-test
  Agent dir: ~/.openclaw-rakitsu-test/agents/assistant/agent
  Model: dgx/your-model-alias
```

OpenClaw read our `providers.dgx`, loaded our agent, resolved our model reference.

### 8. Real chat completion through the sandbox egress proxy

A Node.js script inside the sandbox making an HTTPS POST to the inference host. The connection goes through OpenShell's egress proxy (`your-egress-proxy-ip:3128`) which enforces our Rakitsu-generated policy (host + port + binary allowlist).

```bash
ssh openshell-my-assistant "node -e '
const https = require(\"https\");
const body = JSON.stringify({
  model: \"your-model-alias\",
  messages: [{role: \"user\", content: \"Say exactly: HELLO FROM RAKITSU INSIDE NEMOCLAW SANDBOX\"}],
  max_tokens: 64,
  temperature: 0.1
});
const req = https.request({
  host: \"your-inference-host.example.com\",  // your DGX/vLLM/LiteLLM endpoint
  port: 4443,
  path: \"/v1/chat/completions\",
  method: \"POST\",
  headers: { Authorization: \"Bearer ...\", \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\" }
}, (res) => {
  console.log(\"STATUS\", res.statusCode);
  let d=\"\";
  res.on(\"data\", c => d += c);
  res.on(\"end\", () => console.log(d));
});
req.write(body); req.end();
'"
```

**Output**:
```json
STATUS 200
{
  "id": "chatcmpl-b7311d9c73686383",
  "created": 1775348866,
  "model": "your-model-alias",
  "object": "chat.completion",
  "choices": [{
    "finish_reason": "length",
    "index": 0,
    "message": {
      "content": null,
      "role": "assistant",
      "reasoning_content": "The user asks: \"Say exactly: HELLO FROM RAKITSU INSIDE NEMOCLAW SANDBOX\". They want the assistant to output exactly that phrase. There's no disallowed content..."
    }
  }],
  "usage": {
    "completion_tokens": 64,
    "prompt_tokens": 38,
    "total_tokens": 102
  }
}
```

**HTTP 200 with a valid completion envelope and real `reasoning_content` from Nemotron-120B, through a real NemoClaw sandbox, using Rakitsu's exported policy.** Note `finish_reason: "length"` — the model hit its token budget mid-reasoning and never emitted the final `content`, so this proves the request/response plumbing end-to-end, not that the model completed the literal instruction.

### 9. Teardown

```bash
docker rm -f rakitsu-nemoclaw-test
docker volume prune -f
```

5.8GB reclaimed. Zero residual state.

## Bugs Found and Fixed During Verification

Verification uncovered three real bugs in Rakitsu's export that would have shipped otherwise. Each has a unit regression test that runs in CI (see `internal/export/nemoclaw_test.go`).

### 1. Policy hardcoded port 443

**Symptom**: Sandbox egress proxy rejected connections with `HTTP 403 CONNECT tunnel failed`.

**Cause**: `providerEndpointForType()` always set `Port: 443` regardless of the URL's actual port. Our LiteLLM proxy runs on a non-standard port.

**Fix**: `extractHostPort()` now parses the port from the URL string.

**Regression test**: `TestPolicy_NonStandardPort`

### 2. Policy had literal `${VAR}` as hostname

**Symptom**: Policy YAML contained `host: ${LITELLM_BASE_URL}` — OpenShell's policy engine matches on literal strings, so this never matched anything.

**Cause**: The exporter preserves `${VAR}` references in `openclaw.json` (so the user's API key doesn't leak), but the policy file needs the resolved hostname for OpenShell to allow traffic to it.

**Fix**: `providerEndpointForType()` calls `os.ExpandEnv()` on the baseURL before extracting the host.

**Regression test**: `TestPolicy_EnvVarExpansion`

### 3. Policy missing `binaries:` allowlist

**Symptom**: Even with host and port correct, the sandbox egress proxy blocked connections with `403 Forbidden`.

**Cause**: NemoClaw's egress proxy enforces per-binary allowlists. Our policy had no `binaries:` entries, so the proxy denied all callers by default.

**Fix**: Policy generator now includes `binaries: [{path: /usr/local/bin/node}, {path: /usr/bin/node}]` on the inference policy. Node is the runtime that executes OpenClaw agents and therefore the binary that makes LLM calls.

**Regression test**: Covered by the multi-agent test — verifies `binaries` field is populated.

## Known Limitations

- **`blueprint.yaml` not verified end-to-end**. NemoClaw's blueprint.yaml is NVIDIA-internal — used by `nemoclaw onboard` to package their curated catalog. Users don't pass blueprint.yaml to NemoClaw directly. Rakitsu still generates blueprint.yaml with `--with-blueprint` for contributors who want to submit to NVIDIA's catalog, but this path is not user-facing.
- **Device pairing bypassed**. The `openclaw agent --local` command requires device pairing via the NemoClaw dashboard web UI. For CLI-only verification, we used a direct Node.js script that bypasses the gateway pairing requirement. Real users will either pair through the dashboard or use `openclaw agent` which handles pairing automatically.
- **Single-agent config tested**. Multi-agent pipelines export as one subdirectory per agent; the policy logic is the same, but the per-agent E2E test was not exhaustively repeated for each agent.
- **DinD uses `--privileged`**. This is acceptable for a one-shot test container that's destroyed immediately. Do not use privileged mode for long-running production workloads.

## Why This Test Is NOT in CI

- 2.4 GB sandbox image pull per run (slow + costly GitHub Actions minutes)
- Requires `--privileged` Docker (not supported on all CI runners)
- Requires a valid `NVIDIA_API_KEY` secret (only distributed to trusted maintainers)
- Takes ~5 minutes end-to-end
- The **schema correctness** (what CI should catch) is covered by cheap unit tests in `internal/export/nemoclaw_test.go`

The heavy E2E test runs locally before every release tag. CI catches regressions in the generator logic.

## Reproducing This Test

Prerequisites: Docker, a valid `NVIDIA_API_KEY` from [build.nvidia.com](https://build.nvidia.com), and an OpenAI-compatible inference endpoint (your own or a cloud provider).

```bash
# 1. Clone and build Rakitsu
git clone https://github.com/paupawsan/rakitsu.git
cd rakitsu
make build-embedded

# 2. Create a test config (edit provider URL/key to your endpoint)
cat > /tmp/rakitsu-e2e.yaml <<EOF
name: Rakitsu E2E Test
settings:
  default_provider: myprovider
  providers:
    myprovider:
      type: openai
      api_key: \${MY_API_KEY}
      base_url: \${MY_BASE_URL}
  defaults:
    model: your-model-id
agents:
  - name: Assistant
    role: worker
    provider: myprovider
    model: your-model-id
    system_prompt: You are a helpful assistant.
EOF

# 3. Export
./bin/rakitsu export --format nemoclaw /tmp/rakitsu-e2e.yaml --output /tmp/export

# 4. Start DinD + install NemoClaw
docker run --privileged --name rakitsu-test -d \
  -e MY_BASE_URL -e MY_API_KEY -e NVIDIA_API_KEY \
  docker:dind
# ... (see full steps above)

# 5. Apply policy, upload config, send inference
# ... (see full steps above)

# 6. Cleanup
docker rm -f rakitsu-test
```

## Summary

Rakitsu's NemoClaw export is not marketing. It was proven by running the output through NVIDIA's real infrastructure on NVIDIA's real hardware and receiving a real HTTP 200 from a real model. The bugs found during verification were fixed and covered by regression tests. The claim "Design in Rakitsu, deploy on NemoClaw" stands on real evidence.
