# Rakitsu security & trust model

Read this before running Rakitsu with configs you did not write, or before
exposing `rakitsu serve` to anything beyond your own machine.

Rakitsu runs LLM-driven agents that execute tools — shell commands and file
operations — on your behalf. The security posture depends entirely on **which
of two modes** you are in.

## Mode 1 — local CLI (`rakitsu run`)

Trust model: **the config is yours, and tools run as you.**

When you run `rakitsu run config.yaml "…"`, any `cli` or `fs` tool the config
declares executes with **your user's full permissions**, in your working
directory. This is by design — it is what makes a local coding agent useful.

### The cli tool allowlist is a footgun fence, not a sandbox

The `cli` tool has a built-in command allowlist (`ls`, `cat`, `git`, `go`,
`python3`, `node`, `bash`, …) and a denylist (`rm`, `sudo`, `dd`, …). **Treat
this as a guard rail against obvious mistakes, not as a security boundary.**

The allowlist includes general-purpose interpreters — `python3`, `node`, `go`,
`bash`, `sh` — and `find`. Any of these can execute arbitrary code or delete
files, so the denylist does **not** actually contain a hostile config:

```yaml
# All of these run despite `rm` being "blocked":
python3 -c "import shutil; shutil.rmtree('...')"
find . -delete
bash -c "$(printf 'r''m -rf x')"
```

The shell-payload lint (`lintShellPayload`) is best-effort and trivially
bypassable — the source says so explicitly.

**Consequence:** only run configs you trust, the same way you only run shell
scripts you trust. Do not rely on the allowlist to make a config from an
untrusted source safe.

### `allowed_paths` on cli tools is an argument filter, not containment

`sandbox.allowed_paths` on a `cli` tool makes rakitsu refuse a command whose
**arguments** name a location outside the listed directories. Every
whitespace-separated token of every argument — including the payload of a
`sh -c '…'` template and `--opt=path` / `VAR=path` values — is resolved the
way the command will see it: relative to the directory the command runs in,
with `..` cleaned, symlinks resolved, and `~/` expanded. `cat ../secret`,
`cat /etc/passwd`, `cat link-to-outside` and `sh -c 'cat ~/secret'` are all
refused.

That is the whole guarantee. The filter only sees paths that appear verbatim
as tokens, so it does **not** contain:

- an allowed interpreter opening a path named in its code
  (`python3 -c "open('../secret')"`, `node -e …`);
- a shell payload that builds the path from variables or substitution
  (`sh -c 'cat $HOME/secret'`, `cat $(printf ../secret)`);
- commands re-invoked by `find -exec`, `xargs`, or `env`;
- anything the command reaches through the network.

`local_restricted` is therefore the right default for configs you trust and
want protected from *obvious* mistakes by the model. If untrusted execution
needs a real filesystem boundary, use `sandbox: { type: docker }` — that is
the only mode that provides process isolation.

A parameter's `argv_split: true` (splitting a whole-part templated value
into multiple argv tokens, e.g. for `command: "gh {{args}}"`) doesn't change
any of this: `checkArgPaths` already re-splits every argv element on
whitespace before checking it, whether or not `argv_split` is set.

### Reducing blast radius

- **`fs` tools:** always set `allowed_paths` explicitly. The default is `["."]`
  — the *entire* launch directory — so a config that omits it and is launched
  near secrets can read `.env`, `.git`, credentials, etc. Point it at the
  narrowest directory the task needs. `read` is also capped at 10MB by
  default (`sandbox.resource_limits.max_output_bytes`, `-1` disables it), so a
  huge or special file (a multi-GB log, `/dev/zero`) can't be fully buffered
  into memory before any limit applies.
- **`cli` tools:** keep `settings.allowed_commands` minimal. Every command you
  add is a new capability. `docker` in particular is effectively root on most
  dev machines (it can mount the host and run privileged containers). The
  running `rakitsu` binary itself is always rejected, even if you list it in
  `allowed_commands` — a `cli` tool cannot re-invoke rakitsu to spawn a second
  process against a different config/workdir and escape this session's
  sandboxing. This also catches a symlink or hard link to the binary under
  an unrelated name (checked by file identity, not just the name), but not
  a byte-for-byte copy under a different name — that has its own inode and
  is indistinguishable from any other unknown executable without hashing
  file contents on every `cli` call, which rakitsu deliberately doesn't do.
  The self-invocation check and the actual exec both resolve the command
  to a single, absolute path (rather than each doing their own separate,
  possibly-relative lookup) to close the window between them. **On Linux**,
  the check-then-exec gap is closed entirely: the resolved file is opened
  with `O_PATH` (a location-only open that needs no read permission on the
  file — matching what exec itself needs, so a legitimately execute-only
  command, mode `0111`, still runs), re-verified via that file descriptor's
  own identity, then exec'd through `/proc/self/fd/N` rather than by path —
  an open descriptor keeps referring to its original inode even if the path
  is later replaced, so what was verified and what actually runs are
  provably the same file, no matter what happens to the path in between.
  **On macOS/BSD**, which have no `/proc` and no portable
  file-descriptor-based exec, this extra step doesn't apply: the
  self-invocation check still runs (by resolved path, as above) but a
  narrow, classic check-then-exec race remains between that check and the
  exec syscall, requiring an attacker with concurrent filesystem write
  access to the exact resolved path timed to a sub-millisecond window (a
  materially stronger position than the original gap this section
  describes, which required nothing more than a name in
  `allowed_commands`).
- **Untrusted work:** use `sandbox: { type: docker }` (see below).

### Docker sandbox

`sandbox: { type: docker }` gives stronger isolation than `local_restricted`:
the container's root filesystem is read-only (with a small writable `/tmp`
for scratch space), setuid/setgid privilege escalation is blocked
(`--security-opt=no-new-privileges`), every Linux capability is dropped
(`--cap-drop=ALL`), the container runs as an unprivileged user by default
(`--user`, `65534:65534` unless `sandbox.user` overrides it), a process/thread
count limit applies (`--pids-limit`, 128 by default, `sandbox.resource_limits.
pids_limit` to change it), and the container has **no network access unless
`allow_network: true`** is set. The mounted working directory (`mount_workdir:
true`) is read-only unless `mount_workdir_writable: true` is also set. Prefer
it over local execution for untrusted configs, but it is still a soft
container, not a hardened jail — a kernel exploit or a docker misconfiguration
elsewhere on the host is out of scope for any of the above.

## Mode 2 — the hub (`rakitsu serve`)

Trust model: **loopback-only and single-user by default.**

`rakitsu serve` exposes a control plane that can **upload a config and start a
run** — i.e. it can execute code as the server's user. That is safe on
`localhost` (only you can reach it) and unsafe on any routable interface
without authentication.

### Network exposure requires an API token

Binding a non-loopback host (`--host 0.0.0.0`, a LAN IP, a Tailscale address)
is **refused** unless you set an API token:

```bash
export RAKITSU_API_TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 32 | tr -d '\n')"
rakitsu serve --host 0.0.0.0
```

When the token is set, the control plane is **default-deny**: every request
under `/api/`, `/ws/`, `/events`, `/mcp` and `/a2a` requires
`Authorization: Bearer <token>`. That includes the persisted-session history
(`/api/sessions…` — queries, outputs, stored configs, deletion, rerun), the
uploaded-config list and reads (configs can embed provider API keys), the
live event stream, and the CLI↔hub reporting endpoints (`/api/hub/*`). A
handler added under those prefixes is gated without a code change to the
auth policy.

The only public exceptions are `/health`, `/api/status` (version and boot id
only), the A2A agent card at `/.well-known/agent-card.json` (the spec expects
it to be fetchable so a client can learn what auth is required; the card
advertises the bearer requirement), and the static web UI assets.

The same token also satisfies cross-session messaging
(`RAKITSU_SESSION_MSG_TOKEN` is still accepted for that feature specifically;
`/api/sessions/{id}/message` and `/inbox` are checked by that feature's own
gate so a client holding only the messaging token keeps working).

**CLI runs reporting to a token-protected hub** (`rakitsu run --hub …`,
`rakitsu chat`) must have the same `RAKITSU_API_TOKEN` in their environment;
the hub client sends it on every call, and the cli tool scrubs it from the
subprocesses it spawns so an agent cannot read it back.

### Known limitations (Phase 2)

- The **web UI does not work while a token is set**: the browser cannot
  attach the bearer token to page navigations, `EventSource` or WebSocket
  upgrades, and since the control plane is default-deny the UI loses the
  history browser, config list and live event stream as well as the run/chat
  controls. Run the hub on loopback without a token for local UI use, or
  reach a remote hub through an SSH tunnel and call the API directly with the
  token. UI-side token support is a separate follow-up.
- The **MCP (`/mcp`) and A2A (`/a2a`) endpoints require the same bearer
  token as everything else**, and the standalone `--mcp-port` listener
  mounts the MCP server at `/mcp` only, so no other path on that port can
  reach it. The Agent Card discovery route
  (`/.well-known/agent-card.json`) is deliberately left open — the A2A spec
  expects it to be publicly fetchable so a client can learn what auth is
  required before authenticating, and the card advertises the requirement
  (`securitySchemes`/`security`) whenever `RAKITSU_API_TOKEN` is set. An
  `a2a`-type tool delegating to a token-gated peer supplies the credential
  via its own `api_key` field (`${VAR}`-expanded like provider `api_key`
  values), sent as `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>`. The non-loopback bind
  refusal remains the backstop for all of it — keep it behind a tunnel or a
  trusted network.
- WebSocket upgrades are restricted to localhost/same-origin (so a random web
  page cannot drive your agent), but there is no CSRF token on same-origin
  POSTs yet.

## Telemetry & session logs

Tool-call events (`TOOL_CALL_START`'s and `THOUGHT_END`'s planned-call
`Arguments`) are written to both `~/.rakitsu/sessions/<id>.jsonl` and, when
connected to a hub, the hub's event stream. Any argument whose key looks
credential-shaped (`token`, `api_key`, `password`, `secret`,
`authorization`, case-insensitive) is masked to `[REDACTED]` before either
sink sees it.

This does **not** cover tool *output* — `TOOL_CALL_END.Output`/`.Error` is
free-form text (e.g. whatever a `cat` or `curl` call printed), not a
structured key/value map, so it isn't pattern-scanned yet. If a tool call
prints a secret, that secret can still land in the session file or hub
stream. Don't feed configs/agents that might do that into a shared or
long-lived session without reviewing the log.
