# Rakitsu Web UI Manual

## Overview

The rakitsu web UI is a full-featured agent IDE accessed via `rakitsu serve`. It provides three main views:

- **Builder** — Visual drag-and-drop agent configuration
- **Debugger** — Real-time execution monitoring with breakpoints
- **Inspector** — Event stream viewer

Start the UI:
```bash
rakitsu serve --port 9100
# Open http://localhost:9100
```

## Visual Builder

### Canvas Basics

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Pan canvas | Click and drag on empty space |
| Zoom | Scroll wheel or pinch |
| Fit view | Click the fit-view button in bottom-left controls |
| Add node | Click toolbar buttons: Agent, Tool, Skill, Orchestrator |
| Move node | Click and drag a node |
| Connect nodes | Drag from a source handle to a target handle |
| Edit node | Click a node to open the side panel editor |
| Delete node | Select node(s), press Delete or Backspace |
| Right-click menu | Right-click any node for context actions |

### Node Types

| Type | Purpose | Handles |
|---|---|---|
| **Agent** | LLM-powered worker or supervisor | In (top), Out to tools/skills (bottom) |
| **Tool** | CLI command or filesystem operation | In (top) |
| **Skill** | Reusable tool+prompt combination | In (top) |
| **Orchestrator** | Manages agent coordination strategy | In (top), Out to agents (bottom) |
| **Group** | Container block for grouping nodes | In (top), Out (bottom) |

### Connection Rules

| Source | Valid Targets |
|---|---|
| Orchestrator | Agent, Orchestrator, Group |
| Agent | Tool, Skill, Agent, Orchestrator, Group |
| Group | Agent, Tool, Skill, Orchestrator, Group |
| Tool | (leaf node — no outgoing connections) |
| Skill | (leaf node — no outgoing connections) |

---

## Multi-Select

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Box select | **Shift + drag** on empty canvas |
| Toggle node | **Cmd + click** (Mac) / **Ctrl + click** (Win) |
| Select all same level | Shift+drag covers all nodes at current scope |
| Deselect all | Click empty canvas or press **Escape** |

### Bulk Operations

When multiple nodes are selected, a **Bulk Edit** panel appears:
- Shows count and types of selected nodes
- If all same type (e.g., all agents): edit shared fields (provider, model)
- **Duplicate** — clones all selected nodes + internal edges
- **Delete** — removes all selected with confirmation

---

## Block Programming (Groups)

### Creating Groups

| Method | How |
|---|---|
| Empty group | Click **Pipeline**, **Parallel**, **Team**, or **Group** in toolbar |
| Group selection | Select 2+ nodes → click **Group (N)** button |
| Right-click menu | Multi-select → right-click → "Group as Pipeline/Parallel/Team" |

### Group Types

| Type | Color | Execution Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **Pipeline** | Blue | Children execute sequentially (top to bottom) |
| **Parallel** | Green | Children execute concurrently |
| **Team** | Pink | Children managed by orchestrator (hierarchical) |
| **Generic** | Gray | Visual grouping only — no execution semantics |

### Adding Nodes to Groups

| Method | How |
|---|---|
| Drag and drop | Drag a node over a group → release → overlay menu "Add to group" |
| Nested groups | Drag a node over a nested group → deepest matching group is targeted |
| Re-parent | Drag a node from one group to another → moves between groups |

During drag, the target group **highlights with a blue glow** to show where the node will land.

### Removing Nodes from Groups

| Method | How |
|---|---|
| Ungroup all | Select group → click **Ungroup** or right-click → Ungroup |
| Drag out | (Enter group scope first, then drag node outside) |

### Group Properties

- **Resizable** — select a group, drag the corner/edge handles
- **Minimum size** — 250 x 120 pixels
- **Connectable** — groups have input/output handles for edges

---

## Scope-Based Selection

Selection follows a **hierarchical scope model** (like Maya/Figma):

### Scope Navigation

The **scope widget** appears at the top center of the canvas:

```
[ Canvas ] | Enter: [ Pipeline ] [ Team ]     ← at root
[ Canvas ] / [ Pipeline ] [ ↑ Up ]            ← inside Pipeline
[ Canvas ] / [ Pipeline ] / [ Parallel ] [ ↑ Up ]  ← nested
```

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Enter a group | **Double-click** the group, or click its name in the scope widget |
| Exit group | Press **Escape**, or click **↑ Up**, or click a parent in the scope path |
| Jump to root | Click **Canvas** in the scope widget |

### Selection Rules

1. **Same-level only** — you can only select nodes at the current scope level
2. **Parent overrides children** — if a group is selected, its members can't be individually selected
3. **Selecting a group deselects its descendants** — cleans up conflicting selections
4. **Groups are selectable** — groups at the current scope level can be part of multi-select
5. **Mixed selection** — groups + regular nodes can be selected together at the same level

---

## Settings Panel

Open with the **gear icon** in the toolbar.

### Service Providers

Define LLM providers before configuring agents:

1. Click **+ Add Service Provider**
2. Set **Name** (e.g., "my-openai", "litellm-proxy")
3. Set **Type** (openai, anthropic, gemini, ollama, litellm)
4. Set **Default Model** — auto-discovers from proxy if base_url is set
5. Set **API Key** and **Base URL** as needed

### Defaults

- **Default Provider** — dropdown shows only defined providers
- **Default Model** — auto-discovers from the default provider
- **Temperature**, **Max Tokens** — propagated to agents via inherit/override

### Inherit/Override System

All auto-filled values follow an **inherit/override** pattern:

| Badge | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **inherited** (blue) | Value syncs with its source (e.g., provider's default model) |
| **reset** button | Click to go back to inherited from a manual override |

**Inheritable fields:**
- `model` ← provider's default_model
- `temperature` ← settings.defaults.temperature
- `max_tokens` ← settings.defaults.max_tokens
- `max_iterations` ← settings.execution.max_iterations
- `timeout` ← settings.execution.timeout_seconds

Changing the source (e.g., provider default model) automatically updates all agents with inherited values. Manually overridden values are never touched.

---

## Referential Integrity

All entities have **internal stable IDs** (`_id`). References survive renames:

| Rename | Auto-updates |
|---|---|
| Provider renamed | All agent/orchestrator `provider` fields |
| Tool renamed | All agent `tools[]`, all skill `tools[]` |
| Skill renamed | All agent `skills[]` |
| Agent renamed | Orchestrator `agents[]`, pipeline step `agent` refs |

IDs are stripped on YAML export — clean output with no internal metadata.

---

## Node Editor

Click any node to open the side panel editor.

### Agent Fields

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Name | Agent identifier (used in YAML + references) |
| Role | `worker` or `supervisor` |
| Provider | Select from defined providers |
| Model | Auto-discovers from provider, or type custom |
| System Prompt | Agent instructions (multi-line text) |
| Tools | Chip multi-select from canvas tools + custom input |
| Skills | Chip multi-select from canvas skills |
| Vision | Enable image input support |
| Model Config | Temperature, max tokens, top P, penalties |
| Agent Settings | Max iterations, timeout, reflection, ground check |

### ComboBox Dropdowns

All dropdowns use a custom **ComboBox** component:
- Click to open dropdown with all options
- Type to filter (incremental subsequence matching)
- Toggle **A/F** button to switch between "show All" and "Filter" mode
- Custom values accepted (type and press Enter)

---

## Debugger

### Modes

| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| **Run** | Execute agent, stream events (no debug overhead) |
| **Debug** | Attach debugger with breakpoints, pause/resume, param override |

### Session Panel (right side)

- **Live** tab — active and recent runs
- **History** tab — past sessions from the JSONL session store
- **Search** — incremental chip-based filter (name, query, agent, status, config path)
- **Delete** — single or bulk delete with confirmation
- **Resizable** — drag left edge to resize

### Visualization Styles

Switch with the **Style Selector** dropdown:

| Style | Best For |
|---|---|
| **Tree** | Hierarchical view, compact, most detail |
| **Block Diagram** | Vue Flow graph, visual connections |
| **Timeline** | Time-based horizontal view |
| **Mind Map** | Organic radial layout |

### Breakpoints

Set breakpoints to pause execution at specific points:

| Method | How |
|---|---|
| Breakpoint bar | Select event type + agent name in the toolbar |
| Tree context menu | Right-click a node → "Set Breakpoint" |
| Inline buttons | Select a tree node → click **BP** button |
| Builder context menu | Right-click agent node → "Break before thought/tool/agent" |

**Supported checkpoints:**
`AGENT_START`, `THOUGHT_START`, `THOUGHT_END`, `TOOL_CALL_START`, `REFLECTION_START`, `GROUND_CHECK_START`, `PIPELINE_STEP_START`

### While Paused

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| **Resume** | Continue execution normally |
| **Step** | Advance to next checkpoint |
| **Step In** | Enter the next sub-agent |
| **Step Out** | Resume until leaving current agent |
| **Run to Here** | Resume until reaching a specific node |
| **Stop** | Cancel execution |

### Paused Node Indicators

| Visual | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Orange pulsing background | Node is paused |
| ⏸ icon + "PAUSED" badge | Paused at this node |
| Red dot in gutter | Breakpoint set on this agent |
| Green background + spinner | Currently executing |
| Live status line | Shows what agent is doing (streaming text, tool call, etc.) |

### Debug Experimentation

While paused, override parameters in the Detail Panel:
- **System Prompt** — modify the agent's instructions
- **Max Iterations** — change iteration limit
- **Tools** — enable/disable specific tools
- **Sticky** toggle — override persists across resumes or applies once

### Debug from History

| Action | Where | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Run to Here** | Tree node (live debug) | Resumes until reaching that node |
| **Debug from Here** | Tree node (history) | Re-runs session in debug mode, pauses at that node |
| **Rerun** | Session panel | Re-launches a past session |
| **Inspect in Builder** | Session panel | Loads session config into the visual builder |

## Import / Export

### Import

| Format | How |
|---|---|
| Single YAML | File menu → Import YAML |
| Modular directory | File menu → Import Directory (ZIP or folder) |
| Scaffold template | Toolbar → scaffold preset buttons |

### Export

| Format | How |
|---|---|
| Single YAML | File menu → Export YAML |
| Modular ZIP | File menu → Export Modular |

Internal fields (`_id`, `_providerId`, `_inherited`) are automatically stripped on export.

### Pipeline Import

When importing a config with `orchestrator.strategy: Pipeline`:
- Pipeline steps become **Pipeline group** blocks
- Parallel steps become nested **Parallel group** blocks
- Agents are placed inside their respective groups

---

## Environment Variables

Set env vars for agent execution in the Run dialog:
- Add key-value pairs in the **Environment** section
- Variables are scoped to the execution only (not set on the server process)
- Use `${VAR_NAME}` syntax in YAML configs to reference them

---

## Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| **Delete** / **Backspace** | Delete selected nodes |
| **Escape** | Exit group scope / deselect all |
| **Shift + drag** | Box select multiple nodes |
| **Cmd + click** | Toggle node in multi-selection |
| **Double-click group** | Enter group scope |
| **Cmd + Enter** | Run (in run dialog) |

---

## Workspace Directory

Set the working directory for tool execution:
- **Builder run dialog** — workspace field with orange warning if empty
- **RunLauncher** (session panel) — same field
- Tools execute relative to this directory
- Persists across runs in the session

---

## Tips

- Use **scaffold templates** to get started quickly
- Define **providers in Settings first**, then agents will auto-populate model lists
- Set **default_model on each provider** — new agents inherit it automatically
- Use **Pipeline/Parallel groups** to visualize execution order
- **Double-click groups** to edit children inside
- The **inherit system** keeps settings in sync — use "reset" to go back to defaults
- **Right-click** any node for quick actions (breakpoints, duplicate, delete, group)
