# Contributing to Rakitsu

Thanks for your interest in contributing to **Rakitsu**.

## License

Rakitsu is licensed under the [Business Source License 1.1](LICENSE). By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the same terms. The license converts to Apache License, Version 2.0 four years after each version's first public release.

Please read the `LICENSE` and [`LICENSING.md`](LICENSING.md) files before contributing so you understand the terms and the reasoning behind them.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

All contributions must include a `Signed-off-by` line in the commit message, certifying that you wrote the code (or have the right to submit it) and agree to license it under the same terms as the rest of the project (see [License](#license) above). There's no separate Contributor License Agreement — you keep the copyright to your contribution, and it's licensed to the project under the BSL terms, same as everything else here.

```
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

Add it automatically with `git commit -s`.

This follows the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/):

>
> (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have the right to submit it under the open source license indicated in the file; or
>
> (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source license and I have the right under that license to submit that work with modifications; or
>
> (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.
>

## Conventions

- **Commits:** [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) — `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`
- **Go:** Interfaces in dedicated files, implementations in sub-packages, `NewX(config) *X` constructors
- **Vue:** `<script setup lang="ts">`, composables with `use` prefix, scoped CSS
- **Branches:** `feat/<name>`, `fix/<name>` — never commit directly to main
